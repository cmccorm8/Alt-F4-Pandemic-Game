Video Overview:



Recap of Second 3-Week Plan:

The plan for this 3-week work period involved the continued improvement of the Character Controller and creation
of more advanced Enemy AI. As well as continued work on enemy models and animations, level art creation, 
level design, and implementation of audio resources.


-   Successes:

    -   Player Controller:

        -	Implementation of character double jump was successfully implemented. Additionally,
			an initial implementation for the tracking of the character's infection rate has begun.
			(\~3 hrs)(CM)

    -   Enemy AI:

        -   Implementation of more advanced enemy AI was successful. This includes implementing the 
			ability for an enemy to jump and to follow the player character over obstacles. This was achieved
			through the creation of a new script AdvancedEnemyAI.cs. AndvancedEnemyAI.cs inherits its attributes
			from EnemyAI.cs and implements other features such as testing when the Enemy is grounded through a boolean
			variable. This prevents the enemy from being able to jump endlessly. Trigger event functionality
			was also implemented into AndvancedEnemyAI.cs to assist in determining when an enemy is grounded
			and to assist in the Advanced Enemy in moving over obstacles. These trigger events utilize CircleColliders2D
			configured to act as a trigger. (\~8 hrs) (CM)

    -   Main Menu:

        -	Main Screen was implemented and the have 3 options to choose from : New Game, Options and Quit Game. This was also added to the overall build setting.(\~4 hrs)(SM) 
		
	-   Pause Menu:

        -	Pause Menu was implemented to use ESC key to pause the game during gameplay mode.(\~2 hrs)(SM)
    -   Audio:
        -	Audio files and AudioManager implemented. (\~4 hrs)(KO)

-   Challenges:

    -   One challenge that we are all facing is the challenge of working
        remotely. Working remotely adds more challenges to a typical
        workflow and adds more time to a project.

    -   The Unity learning curve is another challenge that we continue to face during 
		work on our project.

    -   Time Constraints are another challenge as all in this group try
        to balance jobs and other senior level classes while trying to
        work on this senior design project. As the semester goes on, other classes
		get more busy making it harder  to contribute to this project at the same rate.

    -   Making a game is hard and it takes time with only 4 people.
	
	-   Due to this being the midterm month, individuals were busy with other courseworks and did not have enough time to contribute to this project.
	
	- Level 2 need more time as assets needs to be build for that level.
