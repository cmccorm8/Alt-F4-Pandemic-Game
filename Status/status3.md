Recap of Third 3-Week Plan:
---------------------------------

The plan for this 3 week period included: Work on more art and animation assests. Making sure audio assests persist through scene transitions. Continue work on level and UI design. A custom script
to track the player infection rate, and finally work on an NPC AI. 


Successes:
---------------------------------

    -   Player Controller:

        -	Implementation of a script to track player infection rate for use in a "health" bar.
			(\~1 hr)(CM)

    -   NPC AI:

        -   Implementation of a script to handle AI for NPC characters. The NPC will move in a direction until an obstacle or untraversable ground is encountered. 
		When this occurs the NPC will move in the opposite direction. Additionally, the NPC will turn, stop, or walk in a particular direction at random, with the intention
		to make the NPC's seem more realistic(\~7 hrs) (CM)

    -   UI:


    -   Audio:
    
    -	Art and Animation:



Challenges:
---------------------------------

    -   One challenge that we are all facing is the challenge of working
        remotely. Working remotely adds more challenges to a typical
        workflow and adds more time to a project.

    -   The Unity learning curve is another challenge that we continue to face during 
		work on our project.

    -   Time Constraints are another challenge as all in this group try
        to balance jobs and other senior level classes while trying to
        work on this senior design project. As the semester goes on, other classes
		get more busy making it harder  to contribute to this project at the same rate.

    -   Making a game is hard and it takes time with only 4 people.
