Recap of 4th 3-Week Plan:
---------------------------------

The plan for this 3 week period included: Work on more art and animation assests. Make progress toward compeletion of supermarket level.
Continue work on level and UI design. Implement an enemy agro range to prevent enemies from all over the map from swarming the player. Additional work on the NPC AI.  


Successes:
---------------------------------

    -   Enemy AI:

        -  	Implementation of enemy agro utilizing unity cirlce colliders to determine when the player has entered or exited the circle collider. 
		When the player enters the collider, the enemy will begin pursuit. When the player exits the collider, the enemy will stop pursuit.(\~4 hrs) (CM)

    -   UI:
        Added a more complex version of the Options part of the menu i.e. included a way to change resolution, tweak with graphical settings as well as volume control. (\~5 hrs)(SM)
    
	-   Level:
	    Made a new level called the market with some illumination elements.  (\~4 hrs)(SM)

    -   Audio:
    	- 	Additional audio implemented. (\~3 hrs)(KO)
    
    -   Art and Animation:

        -	Created more assets for level design, these include: shelf variations, shelf endings, out of toilet paper signs, and a pack of toilet paper.  (\~5 hrs)(GB)

        -	Implemented an animation controller for the new NPCs and got it working with the new enemy AI  (\~3 hrs)(GB)



Challenges:
---------------------------------

    -   One challenge that we are all facing is the challenge of working
        remotely. Working remotely adds more challenges to a typical
        workflow and adds more time to a project.

    -   The Unity learning curve is another challenge that we continue to face during work on our project.

    -   Time Constraints are another challenge as all in this group try
        to balance jobs and other senior level classes while trying to
        work on this senior design project. As the semester goes on, other classes
		get more busy making it harder  to contribute to this project at the same rate.

    -   Making a game is hard and it takes time with only 4 people.
    
    -	Working with free assets is kind of restrictive and making new art as a beginner is almost impossible without dedicating a good amount of your time.
    
    -	This iteration was a short one, so less work was completed.
