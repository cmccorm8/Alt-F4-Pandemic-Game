Design of Final Product:
---------------------------------
The design of the "final" product has changed quite a lot since the planning phase. "Final", is a term to describe
the current state of the game as we approach the end of this Senior Design. It is by no means a final version, there could
be many months of more work to get our game to a place that we originally envisioned. The design that we settled on 
was to create a platforming type game that is inspired by life during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was decided to emphasize the need
to avoid other characters, e.g the "enemies", while controlling characters going through levels that mirror daily tasks in the 
real world.

-Player Movement:	
	Player movement in the game mirrors that of many platforming games. The character can run, jump, and 
double jump as a way to move through the level while trying to avoid the enemies of the game.

-Player Health:
	The approach that we settled on in regard to player health differs from a traditional game
where events can occur that drain the main characters health. Instead, our approach used an "Infection Meter" 
that tracks the main characters exposure to the virus. Once the the Infection Meter is full, the player has contracted
the virus and the game/current life will be over.

-Enemies:
	The design of the enemies involved characters that will move to within an unacceptable social distance
during the time of a pandemic. When the enemies get within a close distance to the player character, the player character's
infection value will begin to increment.

-Level Design:
	Level design was meant to mirror daily tasks the we in the real world had to experience during the time of a pandemic.
In the beginning we planned to pursue the development of three levels, however, as time passed it was decided to focus on one
level that matched the theme of our game.  This level involves the player character traversing through a grocery store in search
of a fabled item during the time of pandemic, Toilet Paper. The player would have to avoid the enemies of the game while in 
search of this item to avoid getting the virus.

Limitations TODO

Future Direction:
-------------------
The foundation of the game is in a near-complete state. Other aspects of the game that could be considered
for future work on the game include:
-The ability for the player character to stun an enemy in some fashion.
-Objectives that the player would have to complete on each level. 
-Character selection of different player characters that the player could choose from for each level.
-Level transitions.
-A potential "Boss Battle."

The majority of future work would be focused on level design and creation. In the beginning, we had the desire to create
three levels. We only managed to implement one basic level, however, we had plans that involved the adventure 
that the player character experiences on their way to school and work as two more potential levels.

The foundation is there, more time is just needed to make it more of a complete game	
	 
Statement of Work:
---------------------
-Chance:
	I worked as the primary programmer of the game. I implemented the character controller script, 
Enemy AI, NPC AI, as well as other scripts that are used throughout the game.

Reflection:
--------------
Lessons Learned:
	The main lesson learned is that game development is hard and takes time to implement. Otherwise, 
there were many lessons that were learned on how to use Unity as a way to develop games. Unity 
can have a steep learning curve. Once learned, it becomes easier to use and devlope games.

Do it all over again:
	If we had to do it all over again, we would have more realistic goals that what we started with in the beginning.
None in this group had ever used Unity before, so that added to some of our slow progress throughout the semester.
However, if we were to start over today, we might make even more progress due to the knowledge of Unity 
that we have now developed. 

Advice for future teams:
	The main piece of advice for any team that is considering developing a game using Unity is to start 
with a reasonably small game and build on it from there. Set reasonable expectations, under
promise and over deliver.  We would recommend using SCRUM methodology and make the goal
of each iteration to have a "done" game.  Each iteration would build on the previous, but the end of each iteration
the game is in a state of "done."
